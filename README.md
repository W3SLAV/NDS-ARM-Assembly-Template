# NDS-ARM-Assembly-Template
A Template for ARM Assembly on the Nintendo DS, need I say more?

## How to Use
Open Command line and run  `vasmNDS.bat (file location)` to compile your program on the DS, it will be built as `program.nds` in the same folder as `vasmNDS.bat`

## Credits
Special thanks to ChibiAliens for the tutorials in ARM Assembly and for the basis of the example included `NDS_Hello.asm`
